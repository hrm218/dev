                <p class="bio">
                    I believe that, I adapt myself to new places and situations quickly and understand how a process enrolls and develop new ways to improve it. I successfully combined my studies with work, showing myself to be self-motivated, organized and capable of delivering under pressure.
                    <br><br>
                    Recently discovering a strong interest in programming, I enrolled in multiple courses, some online. My aim is to become a knowledgeable web developer, both front and back end.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm still at the beginning of the road, still so much to learn. But I'm eager, motivated to do so. I have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem solving and a drive to see things through to completion.
